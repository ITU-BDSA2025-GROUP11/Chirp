## License (Joakim)
The decision to adopt the MIT License for the project was based on two primary factors:

* The scope of the application
* The educational nature of the project

With these two factors in mind, the simplicity of the MIT license was ideal for a project of relatively small scope as it is easy to implement and future developers only needs to read a small paragraph to fully understand the parameters of the license.

The most significant consideration however was the project’s educational context. As it is unlikely parts of Chirp would be used in a high-stakes commercial environment it was prioritized to take futures students of the course into consideration. The MIT license ensures that future students can study, modify, and take inspiration from our implementation without fear of legal repercussions.


## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others (Joakim)
